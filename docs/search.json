    "title": "Collapsible Kernel Machine Regression for Exposomic Analyses",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract: An important goal of environmental epidemiology is to quantify the complex health risks posed by a wide array of environmental exposures. In analyses focusing on a smaller number of exposures within a mixture, flexible models like Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) are appealing because they allow for non-linear and non-additive associations among mixture components. However, this flexibility comes at the cost of low power and difficult interpretation, particularly in exposomic analyses when the number of exposures is large. We propose a flexible framework that allows for separate selection of additive and non-additive effects, unifying additive models and kernel machine regression. The proposed approach yields increased power and simpler interpretation when there is little evidence of interaction. Further, it allows users to specify separate priors for additive and non-additive effects, and allows for tests of non-additive interaction. We extend the approach to the class of multiple index models, in which the special case of kernel machine - distributed lag models are nested. We apply the method to motivating data from a subcohort of the Human Early Life Exposome (HELIX) study containing 65 mixture components grouped into 13 distinct exposure classes.\nCitation: Glen McGee, Brent A.

    "text": "Abstract: Epidemiological evidence supports an association between exposure to air pollution during pregnancy and birth and child health outcomes. Typically, such associations are estimated by regressing an outcome on daily or weekly measures of exposure during pregnancy using a distributed lag model. However, these associations may be modified by multiple factors. We propose a distributed lag interaction model with index modification that allows for effect modification of a functional predictor by a weighted average of multiple modifiers. Our model allows for simultaneous estimation of modifier index weights and the exposure-time-response function via a spline cross-basis in a Bayesian hierarchical framework. Through simulations, we showed that our model out-performs competing methods when there are multiple modifiers of unknown importance. We applied our proposed method to a Colorado birth cohort to estimate the association between birth weight and air pollution modified by a neighborhood-vulnerability index and to a Mexican birth cohort to estimate the association between birthing-parent cardio-metabolic endpoints and air pollution modified by a birthing-parent lifetime stress index.\nCitation: Danielle Demateis, Sandra India Aldana, Robert O.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract: When examining the relationship between an exposure and an outcome, there is often a time lag between exposure and the observed effect on the outcome. A common statistical approach for estimating the relationship between the outcome and lagged measurements of exposure is a distributed lag model (DLM). Because repeated measurements are often autocorrelated, the lagged effects are typically constrained to vary smoothly over time. A recent statistical development on the smoothing constraint is a tree structured DLM framework. We present an R package dlmtree, available on CRAN, that integrates tree structured DLM and extensions into a comprehensive software package with user-friendly implementation. A conceptual background on tree structured DLMs and demonstration of the fitting process of each model using simulated data are provided. We also demonstrate inference and interpretation using the fitted models, including summary and visualization. Additionally, a built-in shiny app for heterogeneity analysis is included.\nCitation: Seongwon Im, Daniel Mork, Ander Wilson (In press).

    "text": "Abstract: There is substantial interest in estimating the health effects of exposure to environmental mixtures. Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) has emerged as a popular tool for mixture analyses. The health effects of environmental exposures, including mixture exposures, often differ among subpopulations. However, there is little guidance on how to assess such heterogeneity for mixture effects. We provide tools and guidance to conduct BKMR analyses with effect modification, including estimating group-specific effects and between-group differences in effects. We propose a new group-separable BKMR variant for mixture analyses with effect modification by a categorical variable. We compare this new method to a stratified analysis and to a model that includes the categorical modifier directly in the BKMR kernel function in both a simulation study and the analysis of a metals mixture on children’s neurodevelopment with child sex as a binary modifier in a rural Bangladesh cohort. Both stratified BKMR and the new group-separable BKMR have the flexibility to capture interactions and estimate between-group differences. The group-separable BKMR has lower variance compared to stratified BKMR, particularly when there are small subgroup sizes. We provide code and data to implement the methods and reproduce simulations and analyses.\nCitation: Danielle Demateis and Kayleigh P Keller and Brent A Coull and Ander Wilson (In press).
