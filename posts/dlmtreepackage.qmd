**Description:** Estimation of distributed lag models (DLMs) based on a Bayesian additive regression trees framework. Includes several extensions of DLMs: treed DLMs and distributed lag mixture models (Mork and Wilson, 2023) <doi:10.1111/biom.13568>; treed distributed lag nonlinear models (Mork and Wilson, 2022) <doi:10.1093/biostatistics/kxaa051>; heterogeneous DLMs (Mork, et. al., 2024) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2023.2258595>; monotone DLMs (Mork and Wilson, 2024) <doi:10.1214/23-BA1412>. The package also includes visualization tools and a 'shiny' interface to check model convergence and to help interpret results.
